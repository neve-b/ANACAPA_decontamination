# ANACAPA decontamination script

This script "Anacapa_decontam_DNB.py" is a python3 script. 

It removes contaminating reads from an eDNA metabarcode sequencing "taxonomy table" generated by the program ANACAPA. This taxonomy table contains trimmed and filtered sequences assigned to taxa using BLAST.

An example taxon table is included for the 12S-V5 metabarcode: "12S_V5_ASV_taxonomy_detailed.txt"

Module #1 removes human reads. More modules to come.
